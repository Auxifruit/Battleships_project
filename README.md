## GENERAL INFORMATIONS

The goal of this project is to create a program that lets you play Battleship from your terminal.

## HOW TO USE

To play, launch the executable exec. The rules will be explained to you on launch.

To summarize:
1. Create your boats.
2. Place them by choosing the row, column and orientation for each of your boat.
3. Then destroy all the computer's ships before it destroys yours.

Boats can touch each other, so don't hesitate to pull all over the place.

## CREATOR

Project by Guillaume BARRÃ‰ (aka Auxifruit) in ING1 GI2.
