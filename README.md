## GENERAL INFORMATIONS

The goal of this project is to create a program that lets you play Battleship from your terminal.

## HOW TO USE

To play, launch the executable *exec* with the command :
```c
  $ ./exec
```
You'll find it in the *StaticLibrary&exec* folder. The rules will be explained to you on launch.
 
To summarize:
1. Create your boats.
2. Place them by choosing the row, column and orientation for each of your boat.
3. Then destroy all the computer's boats before it destroys yours.

Boats can touch each other, so don't hesitate to shoot everywhere.

## DOCUMENTATION

You'll find all the information about the code by creating the doxygen documentation with the command :
```c
  $ doxygen doxyfile
```
The *index.html* will be in the *html* folder in the *doxygen* folder.

## CREATOR
